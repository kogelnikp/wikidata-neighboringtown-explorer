# Wikidata Neighboring Town Explorer

This tool displays all neighboring towns from Wikidata for any given Austrian municipality. To find missing neighbors it also parses neighboring towns from the corresponding Wikipedia pages.

A demo can be found here:
https://neighborexplorer.kogelnikp.eu

For now the tool is only available in German and for Austrian municipalities.
If you are interested in an English version or any other language, feel free to raise an issue or, even better, create a pull request.
